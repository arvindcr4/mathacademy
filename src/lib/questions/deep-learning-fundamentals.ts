        "A single perceptron computes y = step(w · x + b). Which function class can it perfectly represent?",
      options: [
        "Any Boolean function with enough weights",

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "A perceptron\'s decision boundary is the hyperplane w · x + b = 0. It can only classify inputs that are linearly separable. XOR, for example, cannot be separated by a single line and is famously beyond the perceptron\'s capacity.",

      options: ["True", "False"],
      correctAnswer: "False",
      explanation:
        "A single perceptron can only represent linear decision boundaries. XOR is not linearly separable — no single hyperplane correctly separates the four XOR input points. This fundamental limitation, publicized by Minsky and Papert (1969), motivated multi-layer networks.",

        "The algorithm converges but with higher training error than a logistic regression",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "The perceptron update rule (w ← w + y·x on misclassified samples) is guaranteed to converge only if the data is linearly separable. On non-separable data, it cycles indefinitely — there is no stable weight vector that classifies all samples correctly.",

      explanation:
        "As noted in d2l.ai §12.1.2.3, sigmoid\'s derivative is σ(x)(1−σ(x)), with maximum value 0.25 at x=0. During backpropagation, the gradient signal is multiplied through each layer: |∂L/∂h⁽ˡ⁾| ≤ |∂h⁽ˡ⁺¹⁾/∂h⁽ˡ⁾| · |∂L/∂h⁽ˡ⁺¹⁾|. With σ'(x) ≤ 0.25, after 10 layers: 0.25¹⁰ ≈ 9.5 × 10⁻⁷. Early layers receive a gradient signal ~10⁻⁶ times smaller than the final layer — effectively zero. ReLU\'s derivative is exactly 1 for positive inputs (σ'(x) = 1 if x > 0, else 0), avoiding this multiplicative shrinkage.",
      hints: [
        "Each layer multiplies the gradient by at most 0.25. After 10 layers: 0.25¹⁰ ≈ 10⁻⁶ — the gradient is essentially zero.",

      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "ReLU\'s derivative is 1 when x > 0 and 0 when x < 0 (undefined at x=0, but conventionally set to 0). This property — gradients are either 0 or 1 for positive inputs — prevents vanishing gradients unlike sigmoid (max gradient 0.25), making ReLU the default hidden-layer activation (d2l.ai §5.1.2.1).",

        "ReLU is piecewise linear: it passes the input through unchanged (slope 1) when positive, zeros it when negative.",

      correctAnswer: "True",
      explanation:
        "GELU (Hendrycks & Gimpel, 2016) smoothly gates inputs using the Gaussian CDF — unlike ReLU\'s hard threshold at zero. It produces small negative outputs for slightly-negative inputs (unlike ReLU which hard-zeros them), and has become the default in BERT, GPT-2/3/4, and LLaMA FFN layers due to empirically better performance.",
      hints: [

        "Sigmoid\'s gradient is given by σ(x)(1 − σ(x)). At x = 5, σ(5) ≈ 0.993. What is the gradient, and why does this cause problems in deep networks?",
      options: [
        "Gradient ≈ 0.007; multiplied across 10 saturated layers gives ≈ 7×10⁻²⁰ — essentially zero gradient at early layers",
        "Gradient ≈ 0.5; this is the maximum gradient and causes exploding gradients",

      explanation:
        "At x=5: σ(5)(1−σ(5)) ≈ 0.993 × 0.007 ≈ 0.007. The gradient signal shrinks multiplicatively through each layer: after 10 saturated sigmoid layers, |∂L/∂h⁽¹⁾| ≤ (0.007)¹⁰ ≈ 2.8×10⁻²¹. As d2l.ai §5.4.1.1 explains, sigmoid\'s derivative peaks at 0.25 (at x=0) and is much smaller for |x| > 2 — meaning the gradient vanishes both in saturation and exponentially with network depth. This makes training deep networks with sigmoid activations extremely difficult.",
      hints: [
        "σ(x)(1 − σ(x)) is maximum (0.25) only at x=0. For |x| > 2, gradient < 0.1. At x=5, gradient ≈ 0.007.",

      options: [
        "All neurons learn to detect different features because the inputs to each neuron differ",
        "All neurons compute identical activations and receive identical gradients — they remain permanently identical throughout training, wasting the network\'s capacity",

        "The network converges to zero weights due to weight decay dominance",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        'As d2l.ai §5.4.1.3 explains: "all the elements of W⁽¹⁾ still take the same value" after any update because all neurons receive the same inputs and identical gradients. The network behaves as if it had only one neuron per layer — symmetry is never broken. Random initialization is essential to break this symmetry.',

        "Xavier initialization (Glorot & Bengio, 2010) sets weight variance to σ² = 2/(n_in + n_out). This formula is derived by requiring that the variance of layer outputs and gradients stays constant through forward and backward passes simultaneously.",
      options: ["True", "False"],
      correctAnswer: "True",
      explanation:
        "As derived in d2l.ai §5.4.2.2: forward propagation requires n_in·σ²=1 and backpropagation requires n_out·σ²=1. Since both cannot hold simultaneously, Xavier takes the compromise σ² = 2/(n_in + n_out). This keeps signal variance stable in both directions, preventing vanishing/exploding activations.",
      hints: [
        "The derivation: Var[output] = n_in × σ² × Var[input]. Setting this to Var[input] requires n_in·σ²=1.",

        "He initialization scales weights by √(2/n_in) rather than Xavier\'s √(2/(n_in + n_out)). Why does ReLU require this different factor of 2?",
      options: [
        "ReLU has a gradient of 2 for positive inputs, requiring the larger scaling",
        "ReLU zeros out approximately half its inputs (the negative half), effectively halving the variance. The factor of 2 compensates for this, maintaining variance through the forward pass",
        "The factor of 2 accounts for both the forward and backward pass simultaneously",
        "He initialization uses n_in only because ReLU has no output-side constraint",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "ReLU kills roughly 50% of activations (all negative values become 0), halving the effective variance at each layer. He initialization compensates: instead of σ²=1/n_in (which would give halved variance after ReLU), it uses σ²=2/n_in, maintaining correct activation variance through layers with ReLU.",
      hints: [
        "Xavier assumes activation functions preserve variance symmetrically. ReLU does not — it zeros half the values.",

      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "After normalizing to zero mean and unit variance, γ and β are learnable parameters that allow the layer to output any mean and scale: y = γ·x̂ + β. Without them, normalization could harm the network — for instance, sigmoid near zero is approximately linear, losing non-linearity. γ and β restore full expressiveness.",

      explanation:
        "Layer Norm (Ba et al., 2016) computes statistics across the hidden dimension for each individual token independently.

      explanation:
        "At inference time, BN uses exponential moving averages of training batch statistics (running_mean, running_var).

      question:
        "The receptive field of a neuron in a convolutional neural network is the region of the input image that can influence that neuron's activation, and it grows with each successive convolutional layer.",
      options: ["True", "False"],
      correctAnswer: "True",
      explanation:
        "With a 3x3 convolution, layer 1 neurons see a 3x3 region, layer 2 neurons see a 5x5 region (3x3 plus 1 pixel border on each side from the previous layer), and so on. After L layers with 3x3 kernels, the receptive field is (2L+1) by (2L+1). Deeper networks have larger receptive fields, enabling them to capture long-range spatial dependencies.",

        "Receptive field after L layers of 3x3 convolutions with stride 1: (2L+1) by (2L+1).",

      question:
        "Inductive biases in neural architecture design encode prior assumptions about the problem structure. What inductive bias does a convolutional layer encode that a fully connected layer does not?",
      options: [
        "Temporal ordering — CNNs assume inputs arrive in a fixed sequence",
        "Translation equivariance and locality — CNNs assume that useful features appear in local neighborhoods and that the same feature detector is valid anywhere in the input",
        "Permutation invariance — CNNs assume the order of channels does not matter",
        "Scale invariance — CNNs assume features at different zoom levels are equally important",
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation:
        "Convolutional layers encode two key inductive biases: (1) locality — each filter connects to a local patch, assuming relevant features are local; (2) translation equivariance — the same weights are applied at every position (weight sharing), assuming that a feature detector useful at one location works everywhere. These biases reduce parameters and embed domain knowledge about natural images.",
      hints: [
        "Translation equivariance: if the input shifts, the feature map shifts by the same amount — enabled by weight sharing across positions.",
        "Locality: a 3x3 filter only sees a 3x3 patch — this embeds the prior that nearby pixels are more related than distant ones.",
